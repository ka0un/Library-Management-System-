## Managing a Library Management System: Breaking Down Complexity

> A library management system is complex, so we simplify it by breaking it into smaller parts called subsystems (Abstraction) . This makes it easier to build. We've divided our system into four main components.

 - Frontend (User Interface)

 - High-Level Functions (Backend)

 - Validator Functions (Backend)

 - SQL Wrappers (Backend)

Each of these parts can be constructed independently, yet they synergize to achieve our ultimate objective: a fully functional library management system. As the group leader, I've further subdivided these four subsystems into 40 tasks, assigning each task to individual group members for efficient development and collaboration.
